# Add functions to make certain assertions

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 28, 2018*

- `StringFlagRequiredE`: Assert that a string flag is passed in ([urfave does not support this natively yet](https://github.com/urfave/cli/issues/85))
- `EnvironmentVarRequiredE`: Assert that a certain environment variable is defined.
