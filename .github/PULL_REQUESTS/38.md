# Add GetStdout flavors

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 21, 2021*

This adds `RunCommandAndGetStdout` flavors of `RunCommand`. I could probably do a better job with refactoring to make things DRY, but I don't have enough of an appetite right now to clean things up as this is blocking the architecture catalog automation work.
