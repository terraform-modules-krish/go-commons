# Improve logging. Add panic handling for CLI.

**brikis98** commented *May 26, 2017*

This PR does the following:

1. A few tweaks to the default log settings, including enabling timestamps and showing stack traces.

1. Add a helper method to catch panics in the CLI and still show stack traces for those.
