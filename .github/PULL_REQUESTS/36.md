# Add a package that wraps urfave/cli

**levkohimins** commented *Dec 10, 2020*

1. Get rid of any mention about urfave/cli in Applications. For example if sometime you want to update the version urfave/cli or change cli at all, you won't have to change it in each App.
2. More flexible creating CLI.
