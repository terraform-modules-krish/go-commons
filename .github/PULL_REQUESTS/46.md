Next todo: 
- fix build
- add delete dynamoDB table so test can cleanup after itself
- review comments if they make sense
- run test & confirm intermittent errors seen are expected
- use functionality from cis reop branch & see if the test there still passes
- make sure error handling and logging makes sense and does not add extra code for no reason

Updates on TicketJam:
- remove cleanup, it causes concurrency errors if a test is waiting to lock while another test finished running and deleted the table.
- update the test table to always use the same table, but different lock id strings.

Ahhh! I didn't see that coming! I actually could see that there was many tables created, which didn't seem right, so wanted a way to clean them up! Anyway - thanks for catching this! ðŸ™‡

I believe this is ready for hopefully a final set of eyes @brikis98 if you've got the chance :)

So, I've updated a few more comments actually - hope they make sense now and are useful! Thanks for all the reviews here :)
