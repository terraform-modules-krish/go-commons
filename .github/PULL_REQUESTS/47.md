# Add relevant go badges

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 8, 2021*

This repo was still pointing to godoc badge, which is now deprecated and replaced by pkg.go.dev, so this PR updates the docs link to use pkg.go.dev.

I also pulled the relevant go badges from terratest (goreportcard and go mod version).
