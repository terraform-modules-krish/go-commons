# fix issue with logrus capitalization

**mcalhoun** commented *Jun 26, 2017*

[logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) changed their GitHub repo to all lowercase and broke all go packages that use their library.

See [here](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/553) and [here](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
