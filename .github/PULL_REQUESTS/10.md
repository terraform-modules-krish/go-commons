# Unit tests for shell prompt functions

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 5, 2018*

This refactors the prompt functions to take in `io.Writer` and `io.Reader` so that they are testable. Also adds a bunch of unit tests for the two functions (`speakeasy` doesn't appear to be testable) as a part of that.
