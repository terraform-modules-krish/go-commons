Looks like there is a build error:
```
# github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons/version
version/version.go:16:6: Version redeclared in this block
	previous declaration at version/version.go:12:2
version/version.go:17:2: cannot use Version (type func() string) as type string in return argument
```

Oh, duh. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Any objection to renaming this function to `GetVersion()`?

Thanks for the reviews and for being patient with my neurotic Go syntax obsession.
