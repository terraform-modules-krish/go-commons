# Implement the first version of gruntwork-cli

**brikis98** commented *Dec 21, 2016*

This repo contains common libraries and helpers we can use to build Gruntwork CLI tools. I did a quick pass through a few of our main CLI tools (terragrunt, boilerplate, grunkms) and extracted the pieces that looked reusable. This is just a starting point, so I expect weâ€™ll add lots more to this package as we go along.

Note that I took this opportunity to plug in a better logging library: [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus).

@josh-padnick I'm going to merge this now and start playing with it. I'm sure there will be a number of follow-up commits as I find ways to improve it. Feedback very welcome.
