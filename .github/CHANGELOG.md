# v0.6.0

# v0.5.1
_Released Aug 13, 2019_
### Modules affected

- `random` [**NEW**]

### Description

This release introduces a new module `random`, which exposes utility functions for generating random items.

- `random.RandomString` can be used for generating random strings of specified lengths, pooling from a set of allowed characters passed into the function. For example, to generate a 32 char string only composing of digits, you can do `random.RandomString(32, random.Digits)`. Additionally, you can do `random.RandomString(32, random.LowerLetters + random.SpecialChars)` to generate a 32 char string composing of lowercase letters (`a-z`) and special characters.

# v0.5.0
_Released Aug 13, 2019_
### Modules affected

- `shell` [**BREAKING CHANGE**]

### Description

- You can now set additional environment variables in the execution context for running commands using the `shell` module. This is handled by setting the `Env` attribute on `ShellOptions`.

### Migration guide

If you were manually constructing `ShellOptions`, you will need to ensure you initialize `Env` to an empty map. For example, if you had:

```
options := shell.ShellOptions{}
```

in your code, you will need to update to initialize `Env`:

```
options := shell.ShellOptions{Env: map[string]string{}}
// OR
options.Env = map[string]string{}
```

Note that if you were using `shell.NewShellOptions` to initialize the `ShellOptions`, then you do not need to change anything.

# v0.4.2
_Released Dec 19, 2018_
### Modules affected

- `collections`

### Description

- Adds `BatchListIntoGroupsOf` function, which will take a list and return a list of lists that batches the original list into groups of batchSize elements.

# v0.4.1
_Released Nov 30, 2018_

- `entrypoint`

### Description

- Help text for nested subcommands now follow the same pattern as the app level help text.

### Related links

<br>

# v0.4.0
_Released Nov 28, 2018_
### Modules affected

- `shell`
- `entrypoint`

### Description

- There are now new functions to assert required arguments passed into the CLI: `StringFlagRequiredE` and `EnvironmentVarRequiredE`. (This is in `entrypoint` package).
- There is now a `E` variant for `CommandInstalled` in the `entrypoint` package.
- (**Backwards incompatible**) Stack traces in error messages are now suppressed by default, printing only a simple error message. This leads to better user experience at the expense of potential debuggability. The old behavior can still be restored if the command is run with the environment variable `GRUNTWORK_DEBUG` set to something other than empty string.

# v0.3.0
_Released Nov 28, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-cli/pull/13: The `url.FormatUrl` method now supports URL fragments (e.g., `foo.com#bar`). This is an additional required parameter in the method, so this is a backwards incompatible change.
<br>

# v0.2.1
_Released Nov 27, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-cli/pull/12: Add new `url.FormatUrl` method for building URLs that properly handle escaping, encoding, leading/trailing slashes, etc.
<br>

# v0.2.0
_Released Oct 8, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-cli/pull/11: CLI help printer that can wrap text while preserving indentations in tables.

To use, you can manually override the templates and HelpPrinter functions of the cli, or use `entrypoint.NewApp()` to construct the cli app which will take care of applying the modifications. You can also modify the line width by changing `entrypoint.HelpTextLineWidth` (defaults to 80).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0

## Migration Guide

Previously cli applications were created by calling `entrypoint.NewApp()`, then the application name and version were set after the fact for both the logging and the CLI description.
The new way to do this is a single call to `entrypoint.NewApp(name, version)`

Calling `logging.GetLogger(name, version)` will now return a logrus Entry instead of a logrus Logger. This entry has the name and version preset.

The behavior of the default logger is the same as in previous versions of go-commons.

A new JSON logger is available by calling `logging.SetGLobalLogFormatter("json")`

# v0.10.0
_Released Jul 16, 2021_
### Modules affected

- `shell` [**BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**]
- `awscommons`


### Description

- Add new function to upload string contents to S3 bucket.
- Refactor shell functions to use a common underlying runtime interface.
- New shell run command functions `RunShellCommandAndGetOutputStruct` and `RunShellCommandAndGetOutputStructAndStreamOutput` which will return a struct that captures stdout, stderr, and merged outputs so you can access all of those outputs.
- Refactor implementation of streaming and capturing outputs. This implementation respects the ordering in stdout and stderr better. The previous implementation always preferred to read stdout over stderr, which resulted in delaying the streaming of stderr if both were simultaneously written to. The updated implementation will properly interleave the contents regardless of timing.

**NOTE**: This release introduces changes that modify the behavior of the captured and streamed outputs for the `*StreamOutput` shell functions. Specifically, the streamed logs are now more interleaved, and the output strings will include terminating newlines if the original stdout/stderr included a terminating newline before EOF.
